		<h1>The first cell phone in 1990's</h1>
     		<ul>
     			<li>The first generation mobile phone (1G) refers to the analog 
     			mobile phone, which appeared in Hong Kong, China, the United States 
     			and other film and television works in the 1980s and 1990s. 
     			It was Dr. Cooper of MOTOROLA who first developed the mobile phone. 
     			Due to battery capacity limitations and analog modulation technology 
     	 		requiring large antennas and the development of integrated circuits, 
     	 		the phone was boxy and mobile, not portable. Many people call these 
     	 		phones "bricks" or black gold gang.</li>
     		</ul>
