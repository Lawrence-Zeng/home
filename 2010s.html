		<h1>Smart phone in 2010s </h1>
		<ul>
			<li>In 2010, a year of dramatic changes in the mobile world, three things happened.
			First, a popular mobile phone was born, which marked the rise of apple's mobile phone. It was the 
			iPhone 4.Jobs was still alive at the time, and his landmark product was an instant hit with the iphone. 
			I believe that many people began to understand the iPhone 4 began. The following year, the upgraded 
			version of the iPhone 4S created another brilliant, apple mobile phone officially entered the ranks 
			of mainstream mobile phones</li>
